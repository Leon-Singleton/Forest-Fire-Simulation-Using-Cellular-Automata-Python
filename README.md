# Forest-Fire-Simulation-Using-Cellular-Automata-Python
A simulation investigating the effects of forest fires on developing civilisations and how they can be modelled using cellular automata. The model makes use of different resource ignition thresholds and fuel resource parameters to compare the effectiveness of developing preventative measures. Wind speed and direction has also been modelled within the simulation as well as short-term intervention such as 'water drops'.
