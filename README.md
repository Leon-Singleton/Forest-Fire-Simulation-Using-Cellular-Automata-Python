# Forest-Fire-Simulation-Using-Cellular-Automata-Python
A simulation investigating the effects of forest fires on developing civilisations and how they can be modelled using cellular automate. The model makes use of different resource ignition thresholds and fuel resource parameters to comapre the effectiveness of developing preventative measures. Wind speed and direction has also been modelled within the simulation as well as short-term intervention such as 'water drops'.
