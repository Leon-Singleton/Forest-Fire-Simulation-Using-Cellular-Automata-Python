# CAPyLE
CAPyLE is a cross-platform teaching tool designed and built as part of a final year computer science project. It aims to aid the teaching of cellular automata and how they can be used to model natural systems.

It is written completely in python with minimal dependencies.

## Installation
The installation guide can be found on the [CAPyLE webpages](http://pjworsley.github.io/capyle/installationguide.html)

## Usage
Detailed usage can be found on the [CAPyLE webpages](http://pjworsley.github.io/capyle/).

See below for a quickstart guide:

1. `git clone https://github.com/pjworsley/capyle.git [target-directory]`
2. `cd [target-directory]`
3. Execute main.py either by:
    * `run.bat` / `run.sh`
    * `python main.py`
2. Use the menu bar to select File -> Open. This will open in the folder `./ca_descriptions`.
3. Open one of the example files;
  - `wolframs_1d.py` is Wolfram's elementary 1D automata
  - `gol_2d.py` is Conway's 2D game of life
4. The main GUI elements will now load, feel free to customise the CA parameters on the left hand panel
5. Run the CA with your parameters by clicking the bottom left button 'Apply configuration & run CA'
6. The progress bar will appear as the CA is run
7. After the CA has been run, use the playback controls at the top and the slider at the bottom to run through the simulation.
8. You may save an image of the currently displayed output using the 'Take screenshot' button
